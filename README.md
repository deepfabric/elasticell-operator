# Cell Operator


Cell Operator manages [elasticell](https://github.com/deepfabric/elasticell) clusters on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and automates tasks related to operating a Cell cluster. It makes Cell a truly cloud-native kv-store.

> **Warning:** Currently, Cell Operator is work in progress [WIP] and is NOT ready for production. Use at your own risk.

## Features

- __Safely scaling the Cell cluster__

    Cell Operator empowers Cell store with horizontal scalability on the cloud.

- __Kubernetes package manager support__

    By embracing Kubernetes package manager [Helm](https://helm.sh), users can easily deploy TiDB clusters with only one command.
